In small groups, read your assigned scenario. As a group, decide:

- What does the evidence say?
- How reliable is the evidence?
- Would you recommend action now, or wait for more data?
- How would you handle uncertainty?
- What advice would you give to stakeholders or policymakers?

### üîç Scenario 1: Beavers for Biodiversity?

You are advising a national park agency considering reintroducing **beavers** to restore wetlands and improve biodiversity.

A recent systematic review includes 12 studies:

- 7 found strong positive effects on wetland biodiversity  
- 3 found mixed effects (some species increased, others decreased)  
- 2 found negative effects (e.g., flooding nearby farmland)

The meta-analysis shows:

- **LnRR = 0.30** (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.50)  
- **I¬≤ = 85%** (high heterogeneity)  
- Studies vary across Europe and North America

**Constraints:**

- Public pressure to act fast  
- Budget is limited  
- Concern from local farmers about flooding risks

What do you advise?

### üîç Scenario 2: Should We Ban Neonics?

You are part of a task force evaluating whether to **ban neonicotinoid pesticides** to protect pollinators.

A meta-analysis of 18 field and lab studies found:

- **LnRR = -0.45** (95% CI: -0.60 to -0.30)  
- **I¬≤ = 70%** (moderate heterogeneity)  
- Larger negative effects in lab than in field  
- Some uncertainty in exposure levels in real landscapes

**Constraints:**

- Farmers warn crop yields may suffer without neonics  
- EU has already banned them‚Äîpressure to follow suit  
- Pollinator populations declining nationally

Would you recommend a ban? Would you target specific crops or times of year?

### üîç Scenario 3: Fire for Invasive Plant Control

You're advising a regional conservation agency about using **prescribed burning** to control invasive grass species.

A recent meta-analysis (k = 15) found:

- **LnRR = -0.15** (95% CI: -0.35 to 0.05) ‚Äî not statistically significant  
- **I¬≤ = 92%** (very high heterogeneity)  
- Positive effects in arid zones, negative or neutral in wetter regions  
- Quality scores varied widely across studies

**Constraints:**

- Burning has cultural support from local Indigenous groups  
- Public concerned about air quality and fire risk  
- Invasives are spreading rapidly in some areas

Do you support implementing prescribed burns? Everywhere or only in certain ecosystems?

### üîç Bonus Scenario: Conservation success

You are a team assessing if your country should invest in conservation actions

You see this [paper](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/216053/1/Langhammer_et_al._2024_The_Positive_Impact_of_Conservation_Action_Science_Accepted_Version.pdf) 

Given the results of the paper would you recommend investing in conservation actions?
