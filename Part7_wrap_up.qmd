## Summary of key takeaways

-   Join Communities of Practice (CEE, Cochrane, Campbell, Evidence Synthesis Hackathon)

-   Ask for help

-   Treat Evidence Synthesis as a method

-   High heterogeneity (*expected*) and low powered studies makes ecology **different** to other disciplines

    -   Typical models, "publication bias" assessments and sensitivity analyses might not work for ecological meta-analysis
