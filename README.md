# Oikos Norway 2025: Workshop - From Studies to Solutions: The Power of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis in Ecology 

## Workshop Abstract: 

With the ever-growing body of scientific literature, robust evidence synthesis has become essential in ecology. However, many syntheses still lack the rigour needed for reliable conclusions. This workshop offers a tour through various types of evidence synthesis, focusing on how to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses with the highest standards of transparency and reproducibility. Through a mix of short lectures and hands-on practical sessions, participants will explore key tools and techniques. By the end, attendees will be equipped to synthesise ecological data more effectively, driving better-informed conservation and management decisions. 

## Target Audience: 
The workshop is designed for ecologists, environmental scientists, and conservation practitioners at all career stages who are interested in learning systematic review and meta-analysis techniques. It will particularly benefit those involved in evidence synthesis, research synthesis, or large-scale ecological studies.
