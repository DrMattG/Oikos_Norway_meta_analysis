# Oikos Norway 2025: Workshop - From Studies to Solutions: The Power of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis in Ecology 

## Workshop Abstract: 

With the ever-growing body of scientific literature, robust evidence synthesis has become essential in ecology. However, many syntheses still lack the rigour needed for reliable conclusions. This workshop offers a tour through various types of evidence synthesis, focusing on how to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses with the highest standards of transparency and reproducibility. Through a mix of short lectures and hands-on practical sessions, participants will explore key tools and techniques. By the end, attendees will be equipped to synthesise ecological data more effectively, driving better-informed conservation and management decisions. 

## Target Audience: 
The workshop is designed for ecologists, environmental scientists, and conservation practitioners at all career stages who are interested in learning systematic review and meta-analysis techniques. It will particularly benefit those involved in evidence synthesis, research synthesis, or large-scale ecological studies. 

## Workshop Outline:

09:00 - 09:15 | Introduction: The Role of Evidence Synthesis in Ecology

- Overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- Why do we need rigorous evidence synthesis?
- Common pitfalls and challenges

09:15 - 09:45 | Types of Evidence Synthesis & Best Practices

- Systematic reviews vs. meta-analyses vs. rapid reviews vs. scoping reviews
- Guidance resources
- Defining research questions using PICO

09:45 - 10:15 | Data Collection: Study Screening & Data Extraction
Setting inclusion/exclusion criteria

- Inter-rater reliability and screening tools (e.g., R, Rayyan)
- Extracting effect sizes and moderators


10:15 - 10:30 | Coffee Break

10:30 - 11:00 | Meta-Analysis: Effect Sizes, Models, and Heterogeneity

- Choosing effect size metrics
- Fixed vs. random effects models
- Heterogeneity assessment (I², tau², Q-test)

11:00 - 11:30 | Addressing Bias & Sensitivity Analyses

- Small study bias ("publication bias")
- Sensitivity analysis and robustness checks

11:30 - 11:50 | Reporting & Reproducibility

- PRISMA/ROSES flowcharts and reporting standards
- Ensuring reproducibility (sharing data, R scripts, and protocols)
- Emerging trends: Living meta-analyses, machine learning and AI


11:50 - 12:00 | Closing Remarks & Q&A
